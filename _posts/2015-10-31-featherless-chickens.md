Instead, before the debate, major Bush donors were fretting openly to reporters (not just swiping at Bush anonymously) that his campaign was in a potential "[death spiral][0]." Those concerns may grow larger and louder now, especially given that Rubio and (in my view at least) Christie had effective debates and are plausible replacements for Bush in the "establishment" lane of the GOP field.

Could Bush ride out the storm? Maybe. But his problem isn't a mere lack of "momentum"; his candidacy has[always been flawed][1]. Instead of being the most electable conservative --- the traditional profile of the Republican nominee --- Bush has[never looked all that electable][2]_or_[all that conservative][3].

And Republicans have a lot of alternatives. While Rubio has some problems too --- his third-quarter fundraising was[pretty abysmal][4], for instance --- he[fits the profile][5]of the electable conservative. If Rubio were to falter, the Republican establishment would have a few backup options left, such as Christie or John Kasich (or in an emergency,[even Mitt Romney][6]). These candidates also have flaws,[Christie especially][7], but they aren't necessarily more severe than Bush's.
